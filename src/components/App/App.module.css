/* 

   Linear gradient transitions are not supported by browsers yet (2021). So it's not
   possible to make a transition between two background images that also have linear 
   gradient property applied. The aforementioned property doesn't allow this to happen.
   In order to solve this issue, an 'after' element was created to function as 
   a background overlay. This 'after' is used to position a block on top of the
   background image. Instructions to solve this problem were found in Stackoverflow:
